	about: `
	💙<b>Aleo</b> is a layer 1 blockchain that brings zero-knowledge technology to the Internet. Aleo is the first platform to offer completely private apps. 
	\nAleo is a blockchain that is private, open source, and built for the web by default, we believe Aleo is uniquely positioned to address the shortcomings of blockchain adoption. 
	\n👥With Aleo, users have access to a world of truly personalized web services without relinquishing control over their personal data.

	💡<b>Technology</b>
	\n🔵<b>Aleo</b> is a Layer 1 blockchain using zero knowledge rollups, so aspects of its blockchain transactions benefit from maintaining a level of privacy.
	\n<b>Zero knowledge (zk) proofs</b> are gaining traction in the blockchain space as a solution to a variety of different challenges. The concept has been around for quite a while in the cryptography space, originating in the 1985 paper, The Knowledge Complexity of Interactive Proof Systems. Up until recently, practical use cases have been limited due to computational complexity.
	\n<b>Zcash</b> built a digital currency and transaction protocol leveraging zk proofs as a means of keeping transaction details private when two parties engage in commerce. This addresses one of the challenges of using blockchain for transactions, where you may not want everyone on the planet to know things about who you paid and how much you paid them — just like a majority of people wouldn’t share similar information from their bank account publicly either.
	\nEthereum virtual machine-compatible Layer 2 blockchains, like Polygon, are implementing zk-Rollups, which are essentially a large batch of transactions aggregated by the Layer 2 blockchain and presented to the Ethereum blockchain with a zero knowledge proof that validates their authenticity. This translates to fewer Ethereum transactions, which in turn results in higher throughput and lower gas fees for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
	\n💯Aleo, a Layer 1 blockchain, is expanding on these concepts to create an ecosystem for building decentralized applications for use cases where you may want to have some of the performance benefits from zk rollups, coupled with the notion that certain aspects of blockchain transactions benefit from maintaining a level of privacy.

	<b>❓FAQ</b>
	\n<b>🔵What is Aleo?</b>\nAleo is the world’s first full-stack development platform for private applications (powered by zero-knowledge) with speed, integrity and scale.
	\n<b>🔵Where can I see the entire Aleo ecosystem?</b>\nThere is also a curated list of Aleo & Leo code and resources made by CTO Howard Wu: https://github.com/howardwu/awesome-aleo. You can also learn about the Aleo ecosystem here.
	\n<b>🔵What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)?</b>\nZero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic techniques that allow one party (a prover) to prove to another (a verifier) that a statement about some hidden information is true, without revealing anything about that information beyond the validity of the statement itself.
	\n<b>🔵How is Aleo different from existing smart contract platforms?</b>\nAleo is the only platform that is private-by-default, ensuring no miner-extractable value or front-running.  Furthermore, program execution happens off-chain, so Aleo can support programs of arbitrary size with unlimited runtime. This also means that it’s possible to know exactly how much any execution costs before it’s run.

	<b>🎭Roles</b>
	\nThere are <u>3 roles</u> in the Aleo Ambassador Program:
	\n<b>· Apprentice</b> - a role that is issued after the approval of your application to the Ambassador program. The task of apprentices is to create content in social networks, or within the community.\n<b>· Voyager</b> - “golden apprentices”, they create very high-quality content, plan & host Aleo meetups, and actively participate in the community.\n<b>· Maestro</b> - The highest role in the ambassador program, their task is to check the content from Apprentice & Voyager.

	<b>🏆Rewards</b>
	\nEach ambassador receives Aleo Points for their activity. You can see the amount of points for each task in this blog post: \nhttps://www.aleo.org/post/aleo-ambassador-program-update.\nNote, that Aleo points hold <b>NO INHERENT VALUE</b>. 
	\n🗣The Ambassador can create diverse content, it can be graphics, a video or an article and receive a certain number of points for this. By the end of the month, all points are summed up, if a student gains 2 consecutive months of 30 points, then he can get the title of Voyager.
	\n❗️Each ambassador is required to receive at least 8 points per month, if he does not gain, then he may be expelled.

	<b>🚪How to join</b>
	\nThe Ambassador Program is currently <b>not accepting</b> new applications. To be considered for the upcoming round, you can create useful and engaging content and share it on Discord and other social media platforms. 
	\n👨‍💻You can also answer questions on Discord and familiarize yourself with the technical side of the project. Once the application process opens again, you'll be able to provide all of your contributions in the form of an Aleo resume to increase your chances in becoming an ambassador. All ambassadors will have to undergo KYC.
